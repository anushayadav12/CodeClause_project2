 
**WHAT IS DEEP LEARNING?**

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks on large amounts of data to make predictions, identify patterns, and perform tasks without explicit programming. It has been successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games. TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular frameworks for implementing deep learning models.

**WHAT IS IMAGE PREPROCESSING?**

Image processing involves manipulating and analyzing visual data to enhance or extract information. It encompasses techniques like filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction to improve the quality or extract meaningful insights from images.

**REQUIREMENT FOR THE PROJECT**

1. **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team. It is widely used for building and training deep learning models.

2. **Keras**: An open-source deep learning API written in Python. Keras serves as a high-level interface for neural networks and can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.

3. **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures for efficiently manipulating large datasets and tools for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.

4. **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

5. **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and research.

6. **tqdm**: A library for adding progress bars to loops and other iterable processes. It makes it easy to track the progress of your code execution.

7. **OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python)**: Open Source Computer Vision Library. It provides a wide range of tools for computer vision tasks, such as image and video processing.

8. **scikit-learn**: A simple and efficient machine learning library that provides tools for data analysis and modeling, including classification, regression, clustering, and more.

These libraries are often used together in data science and machine learning projects to perform tasks ranging from data preprocessing and analysis to building and training machine learning models.

**STEPS TO EXECUTE THE PROJECT**

1.   Collecting Images with Expressions
2.   Detecting Faces in the Images and saving them
3.   Training our classifier on the Faces
4.   Recognition of expression in new Images
